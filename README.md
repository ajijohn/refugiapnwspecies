# 🏔️ Climate Refugia Mapping for Species of Concern in the Pacific Northwest

This repository contains spatial data inputs and outputs for identifying potential **climatic refugia** for seven priority species across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. These refugia represent areas buffered from climate shifts—offering critical conservation value under ongoing and future climate change.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

We collaborated closely with **species experts** and **land managers** to define key indicators of climate refugia tailored to each species’ ecological sensitivities and threats.  
This project integrates multiple spatial datasets—including **stream temperature and streamflow projections, vegetation conversion risk, fire frequency, soil moisture,** and **topographic complexity**—to model and map potential refugia across the Pacific Northwest.  

These maps support conservation planning by highlighting areas where species are more likely to persist under future climate scenarios.

### 🎯 Target Species

- **Cascade torrent salamander** (*Rhyacotriton cascadae*)  
- **Rocky Mountain tailed frog** (*Ascaphus montanus*)  
- **Coastal tailed frog** (*Ascaphus truei*)  
- **Greater Sage-grouse** (*Centrocercus urophasianus*)  
- **Pygmy rabbit** (*Brachylagus idahoensis*)  
- **Fisher** (*Pekania pennanti*)  
- **White-headed Woodpecker** (*Leuconotopicus albolarvatus*)

## 📦 Repository Contents

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `/data/` | Spatial input datasets (e.g., DEM derivatives, stream temperature, vegetation change) |
| `/outputs/` | Final refugia maps by species and region (GeoTIFF and shapefile formats) |

---

## 🗺️ Outputs

Each refugia map is available at the **HUC12 watershed scale**, categorized into **low**, **moderate**, or **high** refugia potential.  
These outputs can be integrated into GIS workflows or visualization platforms for regional conservation planning.
