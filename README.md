Climate Refugia Mapping for Species of Concern in the Pacific Northwest

This repository contains spatial data inputs and outputs for identifying potential climatic refugia for seven priority species across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. These refugia represent areas buffered from climate shifts—offering critical conservation value under ongoing and future climate change.

🧭 Project Overview

We collaborated closely with species experts and land managers to define key indicators of climate refugia tailored to each species’ ecological sensitivities and threats. This project integrates multiple spatial datasets—including stream temperature and streamflow projections, vegetation conversion risk, fire frequency, soil moisture, and topographic complexity to model and map potential refugia across the Pacific Northwest. These maps support conservation planning by highlighting areas where species are more likely to persist under future climate scenarios.
Target species:
	•	Cascade torrent salamander (Rhyacotriton cascadae)
	•	Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus)
	•	Coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei)
	•	Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)
	•	Pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis)
	•	Fisher (Pekania pennanti)
	•	White-headed Woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus)

📦 Contents
	•	/data/ — spatial input datasets (DEM derivatives, stream temperature, vegetation change, etc.)
	•	/outputs/ — final refugia maps by species and region

🗺️ Outputs

Each refugia map is available as a GeoTIFF/shapefile, classified into low, moderate, or high refugia potential at the HUC12 level.
